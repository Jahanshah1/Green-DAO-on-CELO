# Green-DAO-on-CELO

## Overview 
A sustainability focused DAO for passing proposals and new ideas for sustainable projects, where investors will get an access to the DAO, this will enable the ecosystem to grow relative to the best interests of those who actively participate in its growth.

## Purpose
The future is about sustanablilty based technologies and anglorithms and Green DAO identifies new sustainable projects which contribute and solve real world problems. For eg - all the investors will be able to read about new sustainable techs/projects on the platform and will be able to pass a proposal in what to fund as a community with a common treasury

## How it works 
I will create a website where people can view into new Eco friendly technologies and upcomming projects ( note - users can also view a project from somewhere else and vote/create a proposal ) and then funding using the common treasury will be up for vote, if there are suffieceint votes then the funding for that project will be executed.

## Tech stack used 
- Solidity 
- OpenZeppelin smart contracts 
- OpenZeppelin Defender 
- CELO plugin
- Typescript
- Javascript 

## Future work 
The whole project will be made public soon with a native front-end
